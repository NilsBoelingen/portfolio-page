        <h2 id="m136">Presences on Social Networks (Social Media)</h2>
        <p>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user
            data in this context to communicate with active users or to provide
            information about us.</p>
        <p>We note that user data may be processed outside the European Union.
            This may pose risks for users because, for example, the enforcement
            of users' rights could be more difficult.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, user data within social networks is usually processed
            for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user
            profiles can be created based on usage behavior and resulting user
            interests. These user profiles can then be used to display
            advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably match
            the users' interests. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored
            on users' computers, containing information about users' usage
            behavior and interests. Additionally, data can be stored in user
            profiles independently of the devices used by users (especially if
            users are members of the respective platforms and are logged
            in).</p>
        <p>For a detailed presentation of the respective processing methods and
            opt-out options, we refer to the privacy policies and information
            provided by the operators of the respective networks.</p>
        <p>Even in the case of requests for information and the exercise of data
            subject rights, we point out that these can be most effectively
            asserted with the providers. Only the providers have access to the
            users' data and can directly take appropriate measures and provide
            information. If you still need assistance, you can contact us.</p>

        <h2 id="m328">Plugins and Embedded Functions as well as Content</h2>
        <p>We integrate functional and content elements into our online
            offering, which are obtained from the servers of their respective
            providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). This
            may include graphics, videos, or maps (hereinafter collectively
            referred to as "content").</p>
        <p>The integration always requires that the third-party providers of
            this content process the IP address of the users, as they could not
            send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP
            address is thus necessary for the presentation of these contents or
            functions. We strive to only use content whose respective providers
            use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content.
            Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible
            graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing
            purposes. Through the "pixel tags," information such as visitor
            traffic on the pages of this website can be evaluated. The
            pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on users'
            devices and may include technical information about the browser and
            operating system, referring websites, visit time, as well as other
            information about the use of our online offering, and may also be
            combined with such information from other sources.</p>
